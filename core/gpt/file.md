| The rest of this paper is organized as follows: | This paper is organized as follows: | The phrase "The rest of" is unnecessary and can be removed. |
| Today's distributed deep learning systems deploy a large number of workers to improve training performance. | Distributed deep learning systems today deploy a large number of workers to improve training performance. | The sentence is grammatically correct, but it sounds better when the adverb "today" is placed at the beginning of the sentence. |
| They widely use parameter servers to store millions of parameters by shards, i.e., one shard per server. | These systems widely use parameter servers to store millions of parameters, with each shard assigned to one server. | The sentence is grammatically correct, but it sounds better when the phrase "These systems" is used instead of "They" to avoid ambiguity. |
| In these systems, each server handles all pull/push requests of the key-value pairs in a parameter shard, limiting the throughput of parameter access. | In these systems, each server handles all pull/push requests for the key-value pairs in a parameter shard, which limits the throughput of parameter access. | The sentence is grammatically correct, but it sounds better when the phrase "for the key-value pairs" is added to clarify the meaning. |
| This paper introduces QuanPS, which provides a multi-master replication method to improve access concurrency of the global parameters. | This paper introduces QuanPS, which provides a multi-master replication method to improve the access concurrency of global parameters. | The sentence is grammatically correct, but it sounds better when the article "the" is added before "access concurrency" to make the meaning clearer. |
| It achieves a near-linear reduction of the communication time with the growing replication factor. | QuanPS achieves a near-linear reduction of communication time as the replication factor grows. | The sentence is grammatically correct, but it sounds better when the phrase "as the replication factor grows" is added to clarify the meaning. |
| We propose SumLattice, a new data type extended from Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) for storing parameters. | We propose SumLattice, a new data type that extends Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) for storing parameters. | The sentence is grammatically correct, but it sounds better when the conjunction "that" is added to make the meaning clearer. |
| Since different SumLattice replicas handle parameters requests simultaneously, they transfer their updates among each other and apply a carefully designed merge function to achieve a consistent state. | Because different SumLattice replicas handle parameter requests simultaneously, they transfer their updates to each other and apply a carefully designed merge function to achieve a consistent state. | The sentence is grammatically correct, but it sounds better when the conjunction "because" is used instead of "since" to indicate causation. |
| These replicas are synchronized in the background gossip protocol, thus following the eventual consistency. | These replicas are synchronized using the background gossip protocol, which ensures eventual consistency. | The sentence is grammatically correct, but it sounds better when the phrase "which ensures eventual consistency" is added to clarify the meaning. |
| To address stale parameter reads caused by eventual consistency, the worker in our system randomly chooses multiple replicas and pulls the most updated parameters among them. | To address stale parameter reads caused by eventual consistency, the worker in our system randomly selects multiple replicas and pulls the most updated parameters from them. | The sentence is grammatically correct, but it sounds better when the verb "selects" is used instead of "chooses" to make the meaning clearer. |
| Based on the specified staleness of querying parameters, we derive formulas to minimize the number of replicas contacted for reducing the pull latency. | We derive formulas based on the specified staleness of querying parameters to minimize the number of replicas contacted and reduce pull latency. | The sentence is grammatically correct, but it sounds better when the phrase "and reduce pull latency" is added to clarify the meaning. |
| We evaluate several convolutional neural networks on a large-scale cluster. | We evaluate several convolutional neural networks on a large-scale cluster and present our experimental results. | The sentence is grammatically correct, but it sounds better when the phrase "and present our experimental results" is added to clarify the purpose of the evaluation. |
| Experimental results show QuanPS achieves 1.91Ã speedup of the total training time and reduces 74.8% communication costs with four replicas while preserving model convergence. | The experimental results show that QuanPS achieves a 1.91Ã speedup of the total training time and reduces communication costs by 74.8% with four replicas, while still preserving model convergence. | The sentence is grammatically correct, but it sounds better when the conjunction "while" is used to show the contrast between the reduced communication costs and the preserved model convergence. |
